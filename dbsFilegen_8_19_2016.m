%% - 3-30-2016 - DJC - response timing file generator - updated 8-19-2016 
% this script will generate two text files. One of these has the sample
% number at which each stimulus train will be delivered. the second has the
% condition which should be read in

%% make the timing file 

% add 500 ms to the ITI times to account for the 500 ms pulse trains - then
% 2500 off 

ITIlo = ITI(1)+0.5;
ITIhi = ITI(2)+0.5;

% number of trials for each voltage - 30. 
% so 30 * 6 ?

randTimes = unifrnd(ITIlo,ITIhi,6*numTrials,1);


% here the vector is converted to the sample number where the stimulus
% train should start to be delivered 
sample = 1; % start with sample 1 
pts = [];
for i = 1:length(randTimes)
    sample = floor(sample + randTimes(i)*fs);
    pts = [pts; sample];
end



%% make the conditions file

stimRand = [];

for i = 1:numTrials
   
    stimRand = [stimRand randperm(stimConds)];
    
end


%% write these times to file for stim train delivery

filename = sprintf('%s_stimTrainDelivery_%s.txt',sid,fileNum);
fileID = fopen(filename,'w+');
fprintf(fileID,'%d\r\n',pts);

%% write these times to file for condition 

filename = sprintf('%s_condition_%s.txt',sid,fileNum);
fileID = fopen(filename,'w+');
fprintf(fileID,'%d\r\n',stimRand);
fclose(fileID);
